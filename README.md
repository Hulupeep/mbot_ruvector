## What If Your Robot Could *Feel*?

Not fake feelings. Not scripted responses. Real emergent emotions that arise from how it experiences the world.

**mBot RuVector** takes a $100 educational robot and gives it a nervous system powered by [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) - the same architecture used for AI at the edge. The result? A robot that gets nervous when you move too fast. That gets curious about new objects. That has a *personality*.

```
Traditional Robot:  IF distance < 10cm THEN reverse()
RuVector Robot:     Sensor → Nervous System → Emergent Behavior
```

The difference? **Surprise.** The robot will do things you didn't program. That's the magic.

---

## ✨ The Magic "What If?"

- **What if** your robot got bored and started doodling?
- **What if** it had a personality that emerged, not a personality you coded?
- **What if** it actually *tried* to win at tic-tac-toe (and got upset when it lost)?
- **What if** sorting LEGOs was fun because your robot had opinions about rare pieces?
- **What if** you could understand AI by watching a robot's "feelings" in real-time?

**That's what we're building.**

## 🎮 What Can It Do?

### 🎨 ArtBot - It Draws What It Feels
Attach a pen. The robot draws art based on its emotional state. Calm = spirals. Startled = jagged lines. Every drawing is a record of its inner experience.

### 🧠 Personality Pets - Same Robot, Different Soul
Five distinct personalities out of the box. **Curious Cleo** investigates everything. **Nervous Nellie** is scared of sudden movements. **Grumpy Gus** does NOT want to play (but secretly does).

### 🎯 GameBot - Finally, Real Play
Tic-tac-toe where the robot *thinks*. Chase where it *tries to catch you*. Simon Says where it judges you. Games with actual emotional stakes.

### 🧹 HelperBot - Chores With Character
LEGO sorter that gets excited about rare pieces. Desk patrol that judges your mess. Tasks become entertainment.

### 📚 LearningLab - Touch AI
Watch the nervous system fire in real-time. Adjust parameters, see behavior change. AI education you can feel.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### What You Need
- Makeblock mBot2 (~$100)
- Laptop with Bluetooth
- Optionally: Servo + pen for drawing

### Run in Simulation (No Hardware)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hulupeep/mbot_ruvector.git
cd mbot_ruvector
cargo run --bin mbot-companion -- --simulate
```

Watch the robot's "brain" in your terminal. It's thinking. It's feeling. It's alive (sort of).

### Run with Real Robot
```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev libudev-dev pkg-config

# Connect via Bluetooth
cargo run --features bluetooth --bin mbot-companion -- --bluetooth

# Or via USB Serial
cargo run --features serial --bin mbot-companion -- --serial /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Start the Dashboard
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` - see the nervous system in real-time.

## 🧪 The Four Reflex Modes

The robot's nervous system has four modes that emerge from experience:

| Mode | Icon | What Triggers It | How It Behaves |
|------|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Calm** | 😌 | Low tension, stability | Gentle, flowing, content |
| **Active** | 🔍 | Curiosity, novelty | Exploring, seeking, alert |
| **Spike** | ⚡ | Sudden change | Quick reactions, startled |
| **Protect** | 🛡️ | Threat detected | Defensive, cautious, retreating |

These aren't programmed states. They **emerge** from the homeostasis system balancing tension, coherence, and energy.

---

## 🎭 Personalities

Same robot. Wildly different behaviors.

| Personality | Vibe | Key Trait |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| 🔍 **Curious Cleo** | "What's THAT?!" | High curiosity drive |
| 😰 **Nervous Nellie** | "Is that safe?" | High tension baseline |
| 😎 **Chill Charlie** | "Whatever." | Low reactivity |
| 🎉 **Bouncy Betty** | "LET'S GO!" | High energy baseline |
| 😤 **Grumpy Gus** | "Ugh, fine." | Low coherence, reluctant |

Create your own with the Personality Mixer!

## 🖊️ Drawing Mode

Attach a servo-controlled pen to the back of your mBot2!

### Hardware Setup

```
      mBot2
    ┌─────────┐
    │         │
    │  [pen]  │  ← Servo on Port 1
    │    │    │     Angle 45° = up
    │    ▼    │     Angle 90° = down
    └─────────┘
```

### Run Drawing Mode

```bash
# Emotional spirograph art
cargo run --features serial --bin mbot-draw -- --serial /dev/ttyUSB0 --draw

# Tic-tac-toe (attach pen first!)
cargo run --features serial --bin mbot-tictactoe -- --serial /dev/ttyUSB0
```
